# 21 01 20 HTML CSS JS Project One

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to build and deploy a to do application! The application will allow you to add and remove tasks from two separate lists; urgent and not urgent. You will give a 10 minute presentation on Monday 01/25 at 6:00 PM walking the class through your final site and speaking to one thing that you found difficult and one thing that you especially like about your site. You will also be asked a few coding questions about your solution. Following presentations the class will walk through the steps to host the site using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Your project will be graded using the rubric listed in the resources section below. 

## Project Requirements

### Documentation
- Drawn wireframe of the application pushed to the project repository before starting development
- Bulleted list of detailed student defined requirements pushed to the project repository before starting development
- A link to your deployed site added to the read me and pushed to the project repository after presentations

### Content
You must have the following content to meet the project requirements but you are welcome to add more appropriate to how you'd like your page to look! A video of a walk through of an example solution is included in the resources section. Do not directly imitate the styling/layout of this example.

Use grid display to layout three distinct elements : a form to add tasks, an element to display urgent tasks, and an element to display non-urgent tasks. The form should have a text field for the task description, a selection field to choose "urgent" or "non-urgent", and a date field to set a task due date. Use bootstrap styling throughout your page.

When a task is added via the form the description and due date should be added to the appropriate element depending on if you chose "urgent" or "non-urgent" from the selection field. The form fields should also clear out when the form is submitted. When a task displayed in either element displaying tasks is clicked a dialog box should appear asking you to confirm if you want to remove the clicked task. If you choose "ok" the clicked tasks should be hidden. Hint : This can be preformed using `event.target` and `setAttribute()`
